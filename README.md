# Notes app

Really simple notes application built with Ionic + Express + Sequelize + MySQL.

## Backend
- Express + Sequelize + MySQL.
- Fully functioning CRUD.
- 100% TypeScript code.
- There's two unused (in the frontend) GET endpoints to get a note by ID, and to get many by title. 

## Frontend

- Aesthetics inspired by other notes applications.
